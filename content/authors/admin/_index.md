I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg. As part of the [IUROPA](http://iuropa.pol.gu.se/) project, I am currently conducting research on European judicial politics. Previously, I was a political advisor in the European Parliament and a research fellow at KU Leuven.

Most of my [research](https://michalovadek.github.io/publication/) addresses different aspects of the interplay between law and politics, frequently in the context of the European Union. I maintain the [eurlex](https://github.com/michalovadek/eurlex) R package for accessing data on European Union law.
