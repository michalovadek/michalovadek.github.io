Scholars have disagreed, however, on the extent to which the Court fears and anticipates negative reactions to its rulings from the Member States. Without a possibility to access internal deliberations, such strategic behaviour by the Court makes it empirically challenging to identify its preferences relative to other actors. I tackle this problem using an item-response theory model designed to estimate institutional preferences from cases concerning procedural and competence disputes. I find that the Court leans on average towards more supranational positions, while also systematically adjusting its rulings in response to Member States’ preferences. Controlling for these effects reveals the European Court of Justice to be even more partial to supranationalism than the pattern of its decisions suggests.","tags":null,"title":"Supranationalism, Constrained?

The provenance of these data is rarely discussed. More often than not, researchers resort to the quick and dirty technique of scraping entire html pages from eur-lex.europa.eu. This is not the optimal, nor preferred (from the perspective of the server host) approach of retrieving data, however, especially as the Publication Office of the European Union, the public body behind Eur-Lex, operates several dedicated APIs for automated retrieval of its data.\nThe allure of web scraping is completely understandable. Not only is it easier to download data that can be readily seen in a user-friendly manner through a browser, using the dedicated APIs requires technical knowledge of semantic web and Client URL technologies, which is not necessarily widespread among researchers. And why go through the pain of learning how to compile SPARQL queries when it is much easier to simply download the web page?\nThe eurlex R package attempts to significantly reduce the overhead associated with using the SPARQL and REST APIs made available by the EU Publication Office. Although at present it does not offer access to the same array of information as comprehensive web scraping might, the package provides simpler, more efficient and transparent access to data on European Union law. This vignette gives a quick guide to the package and an even quicker introduction to the Eur-Lex dataverse.\nThe eurlex package\rThe eurlex package currently envisions the typical use-case to consist of getting bulk information about EU legislation into R as fast as possible. The package contains three core functions to achieve that objective: elx_make_query() to create pre-defined or customized SPARQL queries; elx_run_query() to execute the pre-made or any other manually input query; and elx_fetch_data() to fire GET requests for certain metadata to the REST API.\nelx_make_query(): Generate SPARQL queries\rThe function elx_make_query takes as its first argument the type of resource to be retrieved from the semantic database that powers Eur-Lex (and other publications) called Cellar.\nlibrary(eurlex)\rlibrary(dplyr) # my preference, not needed for the package\rquery_dir \u0026lt;- elx_make_query(resource_type = \u0026quot;directive\u0026quot;)\rCurrently, it is possible to choose from among a host of resource types, including directives, regulations and even case law (see function description for the full list). It is also possible to manually specify a resource type from the eligible list.1\nThe choice of resource type is then reflected in the SPARQL query generated by the function:\nquery_dir %\u0026gt;% glue::as_glue() # for nicer printing\r## PREFIX cdm: \u0026lt;http://publications.europa.eu/ontology/cdm#\u0026gt;\r## PREFIX annot: \u0026lt;http://publications.europa.eu/ontology/annotation#\u0026gt;\r## PREFIX skos:\u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\u0026gt;\r## PREFIX dc:\u0026lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\u0026gt;\r## PREFIX xsd:\u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\u0026gt;\r## PREFIX rdf:\u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\u0026gt;\r## PREFIX owl:\u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\u0026gt;\r## select distinct ?work ?type ?celex where{ ?work cdm:work_has_resource-type ?type.

The queries generated by the function should offer a reliable way of obtaining exhaustive results, as they have been validated by the helpdesk of the Publication Office. At the same time, it is always possible there will be issues either on the query or the database side; please report any you encounter through Github.\nThe other arguments in elx_make_query() relate to additional metadata to be returned. The results include by default the CELEX number and exclude corrigenda (corrections of errors in legislation). Other data needs to be opted into. Make sure to select ones that are logically compatible (e.g. case law does not have a legal basis). More options should be added in the future.\nNote that availability of data for each variable has an impact on the results. The data frame returned by the query will be shrunken to the size of the variable with most missing data. It is recommended to always compare results from a desired query to a minimal query requesting only celex ids.\nelx_make_query(resource_type = \u0026quot;recommendation\u0026quot;, include_date = TRUE, include_lbs = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% glue::as_glue()\r## PREFIX cdm: \u0026lt;http://publications.europa.eu/ontology/cdm#\u0026gt;\r## PREFIX annot: \u0026lt;http://publications.europa.eu/ontology/annotation#\u0026gt;\r## PREFIX skos:\u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\u0026gt;\r## PREFIX dc:\u0026lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\u0026gt;\r## PREFIX xsd:\u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\u0026gt;\r## PREFIX rdf:\u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\u0026gt;\r## PREFIX owl:\u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\u0026gt;\r## select distinct ?work ?type ?celex str(?date) ?lbs ?lbcelex ?lbsuffix where{ ?work cdm:work_has_resource-type ?type.

Obviously, the more data is to be returned, the longer the execution time, varying from a few seconds to several minutes, depending also on your connection.\nThe first column always contains the unique URI of a “work” (legislative act or court judgment) which identifies each resource in Cellar. Several human-readable identifiers are normally associated with each “work” but the most useful one is CELEX, retrieved by default.2\nOne column you should always pay attention to is type (as in resource_type). The URIs contained there reflect the FILTER argument in the SPARQL query, which is manually pre-specified. All resources are indexed as being of one type or another. For example, when retrieving directives, the results are going to return also delegated directives, which might not be desirable, depending on your needs. You can filter results by type to make the necessary adjustments. The queries are expansive by default in the spirit of erring on the side of over-inclusiveness rather than vice versa.\nhead(results$type,5)\r## [1] \u0026quot;http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/resource-type/DIR\u0026quot;\r## [2] \u0026quot;http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/resource-type/DIR\u0026quot;\r## [3] \u0026quot;http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/resource-type/DIR\u0026quot;\r## [4] \u0026quot;http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/resource-type/DIR\u0026quot;\r## [5] \u0026quot;http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/resource-type/DIR\u0026quot;\rresults %\u0026gt;% distinct(type)\r## # A tibble: 3 x 1\r## type ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/resource-type/DIR ## 2 http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/resource-type/DIR_IMPL\r## 3 http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/resource-type/DIR_DEL\rThe data is returned in the long format, which means that rows are recycled up to the length of the variable with the most data points. For example, if 20 directives are returned, each with two legal bases, the resulting data.frame will have 40 rows. Some variables, such as dates, contain unexpectedly several entries for some documents. You should always check the number of unique identifiers in the results instead of assuming that each row is a unique observation.\nEuroVoc descriptors\rEuroVoc is a multilingual thesaurus, keywords from which are used to describe the content of European Union documents. Most resource types that can be retrieved with the pre-defined queries in this package can be accompanied by EuroVoc keywords and these can be retrieved as other variables.\nrec_eurovoc \u0026lt;- elx_make_query(\u0026quot;recommendation\u0026quot;, include_eurovoc = TRUE, limit = 10) %\u0026gt;% elx_run_query() # truncated results for sake of the example\rrec_eurovoc %\u0026gt;% select(celex, eurovoc)\r## # A tibble: 10 x 2\r## celex eurovoc ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 32012H0090 http://eurovoc.europa.eu/1425\r## 2 31962H0816 http://eurovoc.europa.eu/1004\r## 3 31974H0435 http://eurovoc.europa.eu/1085\r## 4 31996H0592 http://eurovoc.europa.eu/1076\r## 5 32015H0818(10) http://eurovoc.europa.eu/1021\r## 6 31974H0256 http://eurovoc.europa.eu/1318\r## 7 31999H0333 http://eurovoc.europa.eu/1442\r## 8 52004SC0086 http://eurovoc.europa.eu/1504\r## 9 32003H0579 http://eurovoc.europa.eu/114 ## 10 E2004C0055 http://eurovoc.europa.eu/1442\rBy default, the endpoint returns the EuroVoc concept codes rather than the labels (keywords).

Many questions and controversies on and around adjudication and the impact of legal regulations hinge on matters of beliefs and behaviour which experimental methods are well-suited to investigate. Moreover, experimental legal research is fairly intuitive and does not require advanced statistical knowledge. Thanks to modern software tools, experiments can be conducted and analysed in the classroom without much prior technical knowledge.

We present an alternative measure of issue attention leveraging the quasi-institutional nature of the Agence Europe daily bulletin which provides comprehensive but independent news coverage of EU affairs. We use text-mining techniques, including dynamic topic modelling, in combination with manual classification to map issue prevalence between 1979 and 2018.

While the received view emphasizes the dominance of lower courts in the preliminary reference procedure, more recent work documents the rise of peak courts as key interlocutors of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Our contribution adds a hitherto underexplored variable to the existing research by focusing not only on how many references national courts send to Luxembourg but also what importance the CJEU attributes to each individual case. We find that peak court references are generally treated as more important than questions submitted by non-peak courts. Consequently, peak courts have bolstered their position vis-à-vis the CJEU in the process of legal integration. We base our findings on the most comprehensive preliminary rulings dataset to date (n = 10,609) that includes all cases received and decided by the Court between 1961 up to and including 2018.","tags":null,"title":"Which Courts Matter Most?

Often the grouping (temporal) level – year in our case – does not carry any particular meaning beyond the fact that years are readily comprehensible to everyone. Can we do better?\nLet’s go back to the same data and visualize the date of each judgment.

Although the x-axis is now a proper continuous timeseries measured in days, there are too many judgments and days in the 20-year period to see clearly any patterns in the data. Increasing the transparency of the data points is a good first step, as darker areas indicate greater density of judgments around that time.\nWe can exploit the full potential of the dates using the statistical concept of kernel density. For ease of interpretation, we can think of this as a smoothed histogram.

The idea is to basically treat the time dimension as just a series of numbers over which a continuous distribution of our data can be drawn.\nSetting y = ..scaled.. scales density to the 0-1 range, which is useful if we want to, for example, compare the kernel density estimates with a histogram that we similarly scale with y = ..ncount... Changing adjust is the simplest way of controlling the smoothing parameter: the lower the value, the less smooth the curve (picks up on more variation). We can similarly adjust the histogram by increasing (decreasing) the number of bins. There is a variety of methods to calculate kernel density and this is controlled through the kernel parameter (“gaussian” by default).\nAlthough caution is required – we are after all estimating a smoothed curve from discrete data points – I have found kernel density estimation to be a valuable tool for exploring temporal patterns. In most cases it is decisively superior to a bar chart with arbitrarily grouped counts on the y-axis. The below is an example from my PhD thesis where I compare a theoretical model of time variation with a kernel density estimate drawn from submission dates of court cases.\n","date":1575676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575676800,"objectID":"46425fcff836f962abdf78e3d28963c8","permalink":"/post/time-series-data-and-kernel-density/","publishdate":"2019-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/time-series-data-and-kernel-density/","section":"post","summary":"In my research I frequently encounter count data that has a temporal dimension.

It proved considerably popular: course registrations reached room capacity (over 50 students) with several more on the waiting list.\nThe course was a first of a kind in Belgium in that it tailored introduction to data analysis to legal research. We faced a number of obstacles in designing and teaching the course:\n\rour target audience did not have a basic scientific vocabulary (e.g. variables/observations)\rno/minimal previous methodological or statistical training\rlittle interest in empirical research\rno experience with programming\ra dearth of continuous variables\r\rThe interest in the course demonstrated, however, that a good portion of young legal researchers in Belgium was at least wary of their limited analytical skillset and willing to learn. We were heartened to see the enthusiasm of many students in the class.\nThe course was split in four 3-hour classes which covered roughly the following topics:\nRectangular spreadsheets and manually coding information in Excel\rFirst steps in R and importing Excel spreadsheet into R\rData wrangling and visualization\rReading PDF files, document-term matrices and wordclouds\r\rWe tried combining topics of general data-related importance, such as rectangular spreadsheets and summary statistics, with tools more specifically relevant to lawyers, such as processing text-data from PDF files.\nIn the Excel part we drew heavily on a fantastically useful paper by Broman and Woo (2018) which catalogues best data organization practices for spreadsheets. The content of this paper was perfectly suited to open our gentle introduction to data analysis.\nUnlike most R courses we focused in particular on working with binary, categorical and character data, at some cost to continuous and numerical data. This was a conscious choice made with the objective of bringing the course as close as possible to how our target group conducted research.\nWe made tidyverse functions a core part of the course, although we also introduced base alternatives. This resulted, among others, in an interesting split between students who quickly took to piping (%\u0026gt;%) and others who preferred the standard method. The full list of packages used during the course:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(readxl)\rlibrary(writexl)\rlibrary(corrplot)\rlibrary(stargazer)\rlibrary(quanteda)\rPlotting focused on trends over time, with data filtered, grouped and summarized using the dplyr toolkit.\ndecisions %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(year) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(avg_length = mean(length)) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x=year,y=avg_length,color=n_judges)) + geom_line() + theme_classic()\rThe course received overall good feedback from the participants. The average rating of the course was 7.9 out of 10. The written feedback brought up the issue of seeing better what R can do. We found it at times a difficult balancing act to demonstrate the very far-reaching capacities of R and teaching the basics of programming. In the future we will present more of the former to stimulate interest in R, as ultimately learning programming hinges a great deal on individual motivation to develop skills outside classroom.\n","date":1550448000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550448000,"objectID":"e63ae2e9e8f06f81ee0774d6524b6936","permalink":"/post/from-law-to-data-flames-course/","publishdate":"2019-02-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/from-law-to-data-flames-course/","section":"post","summary":"In February 2019 I organized and taught a 12-hour course introducing legal researchers to data analysis.

The Brexit Negotiations Game (BNG) was designed to impart basic understanding of international negotiations to students with a law background in a short space of time (4 hours of preparation, 2 hours in class). The average class size was approximately 20 students. Although the class required extensive preparation (22 individually drafted actor-specific dossiers), it received extremely positive feedback from students.\nSimulation setup The game takes place in the week leading up to the day Brexit materializes, i.e. 29 March 2019. The central objective of the game is to negotiate and ratify the Withdrawal Agreement (WA) on terms viewed as most advantageous by each side, actor and player. This will necessarily entail trade-offs and some players/actors might win more than others (some might even lose out entirely). The interests of some players and actors can overlap to an extent, but no two actors/players share the exact same preferences. Note that for the purposes of the BNG the withdrawal agreement may also contain commitments regarding the future EU-UK (trade) relationship.\nThe negotiation of the WA is only successful if both sides also ratify the agreement. As ratification entails specific domestic constraints of which both sides are mindful, the final WA must be such as to satisfy the domestic actors’ preferences in order for them to support its ratification. In the language of Putnam, the win-sets at both Level I and Level II must overlap.\nActors In order to bear out Putnam\u0026rsquo;s two-level game theory in practice, two levels of negotiation were created on both the EU and the UK side.\nEach side (EU/UK) consisted of institutional actors which were in turn made up of the individual players. No side and no actor had completely homogenous preferences; players were instructed to pursue their individual preferences (which varied) even within their institution. The extent to which they have done so depended, however, on their negotiating style.\nSequencing The BNG takes place through successive rounds of simultaneous negotiations. Formal negotiations are followed by informal consultations during which information on each side can be exchanged more freely among the actors and the players. During formal negotiation rounds all players must take their designated place at the table of the actor to whom they belong. Each round adheres to a time limit, although formal rounds can be terminated before the expiry of the time limit upon mutual agreement of the players concerned. It will be the responsibility of all actors to observe the time limits for the sake of successfully reaching and ratifying the agreement.\nIndividual dossiers Each student received an individual dossier prior to the game. This dossier was confidential and contained player-specific preferences, as well as a brief \u0026lsquo;mission statement\u0026rsquo;. Each player was made aware of a pre-defined menu of options concerning each issue; the domestic preference-forming players had, in addition, an indication of which option they should prefer.\nNegotiated agreements In the final phase of the simulation, the negotiating teams (COM/UK GOV) had to draw up a withdrawal agreement, specifying what was agreed on the various issues. The agreement was subsequently put through a ratification process on each side. Only one group did not manage to ratify their agreement.\nFeedback The BNG was part of a tutorial series consisting of 8 tutorials. 73% of students (n = 102) rated the BNG as the best tutorial in the series (10% ranked it second best). On a scale of 1 to 4 (very interesting to not interesting), 57% of students rated the class as very interesting and 27% as interesting (the rest did not provide feedback). When asked which tutorial best focused on developing skills, 83% chose the BNG (as one of two options).\nEssentially all students were happy with the design of the simulation and did not suggest any changes. A few selected remarks from the students (translated from Dutch):\n \u0026ldquo;This tutorial was my favorite. I found it very interesting and hope that it will continue to exist in its current form. It was very interesting to prepare and I learned a lot about an issue that is current. It was also exciting to discover which agreement came to the end and whether it would come through. Great tutorial, certainly keep it!\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;Extremely interesting format. You could also convey this subject in a very dry way, but by letting us each defend our own position, we first got insight into the difficulties involved in negotiations, certainly in a debate with many different actors, each with their own interests. In addition, we were able to properly capture the complex position of each party. The subject matter also remains very good: I would still be able to explain the positions of the different countries, which would not be the case with an ordinary course.\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;I would not change anything.

More specifically, the “apolitical hypothesis” expects the attachment of legally irrelevant political motivation to legal arguments to decrease their attractiveness. The hypothesis is tested in an experimental setting accounting for a varying degree of legal indeterminacy in the domain of European Union law.

The selection of this simplified corpus of EU trade law is driven by the so-called legal basis which signifies the existence of EU competence in a given area – in this case international trade. We focus on the EU’s competence regarding the common commercial policy and the common customs tariff which constitute the core of EU trade powers. We find that the expansion of the latter has, counterintuitively, not translated into an increase in the quantity of trade acts produced by the EU, and we sketch out possible explanations for the quantitative trends observed in our data.","tags":null,"title":"The Evolution of EU Trade Law Through the Prism of Competence: A Quantitative, Longitudinal Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536444000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536444000,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Michal Ovádek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6ed7391c28f54832c69b38f1edb9d438","permalink":"/publication/ovadek-2018/","publishdate":"2021-11-13T15:18:18.921941Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ovadek-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The rule of law belongs to the values the EU proclaims it is founded upon.
